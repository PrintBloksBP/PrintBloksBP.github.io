description: [Telos EVM] (https://www.telos.net/evm#3D-cards) is a scalable solution for Solidity based applications, built with the intent of revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. Unlike other scalable EVMs, Telos EVM is not just a fork of the original Go Ethereum code. Itâ€™s an entirely new EVM redesigned from the ground up to take full advantage of the power that Telos technology has to offer.
